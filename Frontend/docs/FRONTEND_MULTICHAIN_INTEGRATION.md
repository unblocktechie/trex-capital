# Frontend Multichain Integration Guide
 
## Purpose
 
The backend now treats the database as the source of truth for supported networks, network contracts, payment tokens, confirmations, indexer start blocks, and per-user ONCHAINID records.
 
The frontend must never hardcode a chain ID, RPC URL, Identity Factory, Platform Controller, TREX Factory, or payment-token address. Read the selected network and token from the APIs below.
 
## Important identifiers
 
- `chainUid` is the backend identifier used in forms and admin APIs.

- `chainId` is the EVM network identifier used by the wallet and transaction-confirm API.

- Every token has one immutable `chainUid` after token creation starts.

- Every payment token belongs to exactly one `chainUid`.

- An Issuer or Investor has a separate ONCHAINID for each unlocked chain.
 
## 1. Load supported chains
 
Public network selector:
 
```http

GET /api/v1/chains

```
 
The response includes wallet-safe data such as:
 
```json

{

  "chainUid": "60000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000001",

  "chainCode": "SEPOLIA",

  "chainName": "Ethereum Sepolia",

  "chainId": 11155111,

  "networkName": "sepolia",

  "nativeCurrencyName": "Sepolia Ether",

  "nativeCurrencySymbol": "ETH",

  "nativeCurrencyDecimals": 18,

  "publicRpcUrl": "https://ethereum-sepolia-rpc.publicnode.com",

  "explorerUrl": "https://sepolia.etherscan.io",

  "identityFactoryAddress": "0x...",

  "platformControllerAddress": "0x...",

  "trexFactoryAddress": "0x...",

  "isTestnet": true,

  "isDefault": true

}

```
 
Private signer keys and internal RPC URLs are never returned.
 
## 2. Onboarding: select the first chain
 
Add `chainUid` to the final onboarding submission.
 
Issuer:
 
```http

POST /api/v1/organizations/me/submit

Authorization: Bearer <issuerJwt>

Content-Type: application/json
 
{

  "walletAddress": "0xIssuerWallet",

  "chainUid": "60000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000001"

}

```
 
The Issuer ONCHAINID is created on this chain when an administrator approves the organization.
 
Investor:
 
```http

POST /api/v1/investors/me/submit

Authorization: Bearer <investorJwt>

Content-Type: application/json
 
{

  "walletAddress": "0xInvestorWallet",

  "chainUid": "60000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000001"

}

```
 
The Investor ONCHAINID is created on this chain during submission. Existing clients that omit `chainUid` temporarily use the configured default chain, but new frontend code must always send it.
 
## 3. Display locked and unlocked chains
 
After onboarding, load the authenticated user's chain access:
 
```http

GET /api/v1/chains/me

Authorization: Bearer <jwt>

```
 
Each item adds:
 
```json

{

  "isUnlocked": false,

  "identityStatus": "LOCKED",

  "identityAddress": null,

  "identityTransactionHash": null,

  "identityErrorCode": null,

  "identityErrorMessage": null

}

```
 
Supported UI states:
 
| `identityStatus` | `isUnlocked` | Frontend action |

|---|---:|---|

| `LOCKED` | false | Show **Unlock chain** |

| `CREATING` | false | Disable the button and show **Creation in progress** |

| `FAILED` | false | Show safe error and allow retry |

| `CREATED` | true | Show **Unlocked** and ONCHAINID address |
 
## 4. Unlock another chain
 
```http

POST /api/v1/chains/:chainUid/unlock

Authorization: Bearer <jwt>

```
 
No body is required. The backend:
 
1. verifies completed onboarding and the registered wallet;

2. acquires an idempotent per-user/per-chain creation reservation;

3. submits/reuses the ONCHAINID through that chain's configured ID Factory Access Manager, which delegates to the Identity Factory;

4. stores the identity address and authoritative transaction metadata;

5. marks the chain unlocked only after creation succeeds.
 
Do not open MetaMask for this operation. The configured platform signer performs ONCHAINID creation. If the API returns `CHAIN_IDENTITY_CREATION_IN_PROGRESS`, keep the chain locked, poll `GET /api/v1/chains/me`, and do not call unlock repeatedly in parallel.
 
## 5. Select payment tokens by chain

Load the selected network configuration:

```http
GET /api/v1/chains/<chainUid>/config
```

Use only `data.paymentTokens` for token-creation and payment-token selectors. Do not merge a local token list. The backend returns active database rows that are also present in that chain's Platform Controller `paymentTokens()` result.

If the on-chain allowlist cannot be verified, the API fails closed with `PAYMENT_TOKEN_REGISTRY_UNAVAILABLE`.

## 6. Token creation
 
Send the selected `chainUid` in the first token step:
 
```http

PUT /api/v1/tokens/me/information

Authorization: Bearer <issuerJwt>

Content-Type: multipart/form-data
 
chainUid=<selectedChainUid>

paymentTokenAddress=<address returned for that chain>

...

```
 
Rules:
 
- the Issuer must first unlock the selected chain;

- `paymentTokenAddress` must belong to the same chain;

- the backend assigns the chain's Platform Controller as Token Agent;

- the chain cannot change after token creation starts;

- wallet switching must use the returned `chainId` before deployment;

- send the same `chainId` to transaction confirmation APIs.
 
## 7. Invest, transfer, redemption, registry, and claims
 
The wallet execution architecture remains:
 
```text

User wallet -> selected chain contract -> blockchain

Blockchain event -> chain-specific indexer -> canonical database history

```
 
For the fast transaction-confirm endpoint, always send the actual wallet chain:
 
```http

POST /api/v1/investments/transactions/confirm
 
{

  "chainId": 11155111,

  "txHash": "0x...",

  "tokenUid": "...",

  "expectedAction": "INVEST"

}

```
 
The backend rejects a transaction when `chainId` does not match the token's stored `chainUid`. The indexers independently recover missed confirmations per chain, so browser refreshes and frontend outages do not lose confirmed events.
 
Transaction history can be restricted to the selected wallet network with

`GET /api/v1/investments/transactions?chainId=<chainId>`. If omitted, the API returns the

authorized user's activity across every supported chain; each item includes `chainUid`, `chainId`,

`chainName`, `networkName`, `explorerUrl`, and that chain's `requiredConfirmations`.
 
Identity Registry and claim flows use the Investor and Issuer ONCHAINID records for the token's chain. If either party has not unlocked that chain, the backend returns a chain identity/eligibility error and the UI should direct the user to the chain access screen.
 
## 8. Wallet network helper
 
Use `wallet_switchEthereumChain` with the hexadecimal `chainId`. If the wallet reports an unknown chain, use `wallet_addEthereumChain` with:
 
- `chainId`

- `chainName`

- `nativeCurrencyName`, `nativeCurrencySymbol`, `nativeCurrencyDecimals`

- `publicRpcUrl`

- `explorerUrl`
 
Never use an internal backend RPC URL.
 
## 9. Admin chain APIs

All endpoints below require a Super Admin JWT and database permission:

```text
GET    /api/v1/admin/chains
POST   /api/v1/admin/chains
GET    /api/v1/admin/chains/:chainUid
PATCH  /api/v1/admin/chains/:chainUid
PUT    /api/v1/admin/chains/:chainUid/image
GET    /api/v1/admin/chains/:chainUid/audits
```

Create example:

```json
{
  "chainCode": "AMOY",
  "chainName": "Polygon Amoy",
  "chainId": 80002,
  "networkName": "amoy",
  "nativeCurrencyName": "POL",
  "nativeCurrencySymbol": "POL",
  "nativeCurrencyDecimals": 18,
  "rpcUrl": "https://internal-rpc.example",
  "fallbackRpcUrls": ["https://fallback-rpc.example"],
  "publicRpcUrl": "https://public-rpc.example",
  "explorerUrl": "https://amoy.polygonscan.com",
  "identityFactoryAddress": "0x...",
  "platformControllerAddress": "0x...",
  "trexFactoryAddress": "0x...",
  "deployerAddress": "0x...",
  "deployerPrivateKey": "0x...",
  "confirmations": 2,
  "registryConfirmations": 2,
  "deploymentStartBlock": 0,
  "claimIndexerStartBlock": 0,
  "registryIndexerStartBlock": 0,
  "transactionIndexerStartBlock": 0,
  "indexersEnabled": true,
  "isTestnet": true,
  "isDefault": false,
  "isActive": true
}
```

The primary RPC is verified against `chainId` before save. `deployerPrivateKey` is write-only, must match `deployerAddress`, and is encrypted before storage. Admin responses return `hasDeployerPrivateKey`, `hasRpcUrl`, and `fallbackRpcCount`, never the secret values.

After creation the JSON update API accepts only:

```json
{
  "publicRpcUrl": "https://public-rpc.example",
  "explorerUrl": "https://explorer.example",
  "fallbackRpcUrls": ["https://internal-fallback.example"],
  "isActive": true
}
```

All other network fields are immutable. Networks cannot be deleted; use `isActive: false`.

Every actual change is recorded in `chainMasterAudit`. Upload the optional create image as `multipart/form-data` field `image`, or add/replace it later with the dedicated image endpoint.

When creating a chain as multipart, send `fallbackRpcUrls` and `delegationManagerAddresses` as JSON-array strings. Images must be PNG, JPEG, WebP, or safe SVG, at most 2 MB, between 256x256 and 4096x4096, and are signature-checked and optimized to metadata-free WebP by the backend.

## 10. Admin payment-token APIs

```text
GET    /api/v1/admin/payment-tokens?chainUid=<uid>
POST   /api/v1/admin/payment-tokens
GET    /api/v1/admin/payment-tokens/:paymentTokenUid
PATCH  /api/v1/admin/payment-tokens/:paymentTokenUid
DELETE /api/v1/admin/payment-tokens/:paymentTokenUid
PUT    /api/v1/admin/payment-tokens/:paymentTokenUid/image
```

Create example:

```json
{
  "chainUid": "60000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000001",
  "paymentTokenCode": "USDC",
  "paymentTokenName": "USD Coin",
  "paymentTokenSymbol": "USDC",
  "contractAddress": "0x...",
  "decimals": 6,
  "supportsPurchase": true,
  "supportsRedemption": true,
  "isDefault": false,
  "displayOrder": 20,
  "isActive": true
}
```

One default payment token is allowed per chain. `supportsPurchase` and `supportsRedemption` are set during creation and must not be included in PATCH requests. An in-use token cannot move to another chain or be deleted; disable it instead. Images use multipart field `image` during create or through the dedicated image endpoint. Public APIs still filter the database list against the Platform Controller on-chain allowlist.

## 11. Frontend migration checklist
 
1. Remove hardcoded network/contract/payment-token constants.

2. Load `GET /chains` before onboarding and network selection.

3. Send `chainUid` on Issuer and Investor submission.

4. Add a chain-access screen backed by `GET /chains/me`.

5. Call `POST /chains/:chainUid/unlock` only after explicit user action.

6. Require `isUnlocked === true` before token creation or chain-specific regulated actions.

7. Reload payment tokens whenever the selected chain changes.

8. Store both `chainUid` and `chainId` in frontend state; do not treat them as interchangeable.

9. Switch the wallet network before submitting any transaction.

10. Continue sending `chainId` and `txHash` to the optional fast confirmation endpoint.

11. Keep transaction history/indexer polling; the frontend notification is not the sole source of truth.

12. Handle `CHAIN_LOCKED`, `UNSUPPORTED_CHAIN`, `CHAIN_IDENTITY_CREATION_IN_PROGRESS`, `CHAIN_IDENTITY_CREATION_FAILED`, and `PAYMENT_TOKEN_REGISTRY_UNAVAILABLE` explicitly.
