# Investor first-time UX refresh

This update keeps the existing routes, APIs, wallet guards, investment transactions, USDT approval flow, transfer flow, redemption flow, and backend status handling intact. The changes are limited to presentation, information hierarchy, progressive disclosure, labels, helper text, and responsive styling.

## Screens updated

### Investor dashboard
- Makes the next action the primary message.
- Uses business-friendly labels such as Approved investments and Available investments.
- Replaces the blockchain-heavy identity summary with an Account setup summary.
- Keeps blockchain identity information available under Technical details.

### Marketplace
- Renames the main heading to Explore investments.
- Simplifies filters and card metrics.
- Removes the token standard from the primary card view.
- Uses Price per unit, Maximum you can hold, Issuer country, and Investor limit.

### Investment details
- Fixes the top application header so marketplace detail routes show Investment Details instead of Dashboard.
- Moves token standard, decimals, blockchain identity, and registry addresses into collapsed Technical details.
- Changes KYC-style labels to Identity verification and accredited-investor language to Investment eligibility check.

### Manage Investments
- Renames Manage Tokens to Manage Investments without changing its route.
- Adds a short explanation for Invest more, Send, and Redeem.
- Keeps approved-investment selection and action tabs intact.

### Invest

### Redeem
- Explains the issuer-review/payment-readiness sequence in plain language.
- Makes it clear when the investor should wait while the issuer reviews and executes Redeem.
- Keeps the investor limited to creating/confirming the request; the issuer organization wallet signs the final redemption transaction.
- Moves blockchain network information behind Technical details.

### Investor profile
- Explains what the profile is used for and what the investor should do next.
- Keeps registered wallet and document counts prominent.
- Moves blockchain identity/network/balance information behind Technical wallet details.

## Responsive behavior

- Existing desktop, tablet, and mobile breakpoints remain intact.
