/**
 * Legacy issuer-payment entry point retained as a defensive compatibility
 * guard. Redemption settlement must never be sent with an issuer-signed ERC-20
 * transfer. The issuer only grants USDT allowance to the Platform Controller;
 * the issuer executes controller.redeem(investor, token, tokenAmount), which
 * burns the investor's tokens and transfers USDT from the issuer to that same
 * investor atomically. No standalone ERC-20 payment transaction is permitted.
 *
 * Current issuer UI uses approvePlatformRedemptionFunding() and
 * submitPlatformRedemption() from the Platform Controller service instead of
 * this legacy function.
