# Postman collection

Import `Trex Launchpad Backend.postman_collection.json` into Postman.

1. Start the API and run `npm run seed:admin` once.
2. Update collection variables `baseUrl`, `adminEmail`, and `adminPassword` if they differ from `.env`.
3. Run **Authentication / Admin Login**. Its test script saves `adminToken` automatically.
4. Run CRUD requests in folder order: create, list, get, update, delete. Create responses automatically save each UID.
5. For the public signup flow, run **Signup (Issuer Example)**, copy the latest email token into `verificationToken`, and run **Verify Email**. It uses `POST`, verifies the email, creates a login session, and saves `userToken` automatically. Change `isIssuer` to `false` in the signup body to test Investor assignment. Do the same with `resetToken` for password reset.
6. **User Login** is optional after Verify Email and can be used to test password login separately. Then use **Organization Onboarding** in order. Reference requests automatically capture sample country/state/city and option UIDs. Select local PDF/PNG/JPG files in the upload request and repeat it for every required document type before final submission. The delete-document request is optional; re-upload the deleted required type before submitting.
7. Configure a funded Sepolia deployer and the OnchainID factory variables from `.env.example`. Use **Admin Organization Review** with `adminToken` to list pending submissions, load the complete application, preview/download its documents, and run either the approve or reject example (not both against the same application). Approval creates or reuses the wallet's OnchainID before changing status. The rejection example sets `rejectionReason`; after one issuer revision and resubmission, a second rejection returns `canResubmit: false`.
8. After organization approval, run **Token Creation** with `userToken`. Select a real token image in Step 1, then run claims, compliance, and governance. Deploy the TREX suite from the frontend wallet, paste its confirmed hash into `tokenDeployTxHash`, and run final submission. The backend verifies the configured factory event and returns `deployed`; invalid or failed receipts are stored as `deploymentFailed`.
9. For **Add to Registry**, use an issuer-owned `claimSubmitted` interest. Run Create or Resume Registry Registration, use only its returned parameters in MetaMask, paste the real Sepolia hash into `registryTxHash`, and run Confirm Registry Transaction. The create test captures `registryRegistrationUid`; `202` means keep polling and only `CONFIRMED` is complete.
10. Invest, Send, and Redeem are signed directly by the investor wallet. Paste the resulting hash
    into `blockchainTransactionHash`, select the matching `expectedAction`, and run **Confirm
    Frontend Wallet Transaction**. `SUBMITTED` means wait/poll history without opening MetaMask
    again; `CONFIRMED` is verified canonical completion. The background indexer also recovers the
    transaction if this API is never called. Use **List Canonical Blockchain Transactions** for new
    UI history and **Export Canonical Blockchain Transactions** for full CSV export.
11. For **Token Redemption**, retain the request, investor authorization, and issuer decision.
    The issuer grants the Platform Controller reusable USDT allowance directly from its wallet.
    The issuer then signs `PlatformController.redeem(investor, token, tokenAmount)` and calls the
    canonical confirmation endpoint using the Issuer JWT; confirm/index that one atomic transaction.
    Do not send issuer USDT separately and do not call legacy payment-confirm or Retry APIs.
12. For **Investor Invitations**, set `investmentTokenUid`, run **Issuer - List Completed Investors**
    with the issuer `userToken`, then run **Issuer - Invite Investor**. The test stores
    `invitationInvestorUid` and `investorInvitationUid`. Switch to `investorToken` for inbox,
    detail, and mark-viewed requests. Re-run the issuer invite to verify it returns HTTP `200` and
    does not send another email.
13. For **Token Transfer**, call `token.transfer()` directly from the registered investor wallet.
    Do not create a backend transfer intent or use backend-prepared calldata. Submit the observed
    hash to the canonical confirmation endpoint with `expectedAction=TRANSFER`; the legacy transfer
    folder is read-only during production-data migration.
14. Apply `20260902_add_current_token_price.sql`, then run **Update Current Token Price** as the
    owning issuer. New purchase/redemption/transfer intents snapshot that price; old records are not
    repriced.

Revised issuer submissions return `status: resubmitted`; use `status=resubmitted` on the admin list endpoint to filter them.

Signup and managed-user emails, role names, menu codes, permission codes, API paths, and setting keys use timestamps so repeated runs do not collide with previous data.

The collection includes stable `issuerRoleUid` and `investorRoleUid` variables plus organization/location variables populated by request tests.
Registry testing also uses `registryRegistrationUid` (captured automatically) and `registryTxHash` (a real issuer-wallet `registerIdentity` transaction).
