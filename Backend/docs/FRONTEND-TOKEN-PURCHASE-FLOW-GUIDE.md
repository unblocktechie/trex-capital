# Frontend Token Purchase Flow (deprecated)

> Do not implement this legacy create/confirm/retry flow. Use
> `FRONTEND-BLOCKCHAIN-TRANSACTION-GUIDE.md`; the investor now calls `PlatformController.buy()`
> directly and reports only the observed hash to the optional canonical confirmation endpoint.

This guide describes the investor purchase screen, MetaMask interaction, confirmation call, and
token-specific history table. The backend response `data.status` is the settlement source of truth.
Do not infer blockchain state from an HTTP 200 response alone.

## Endpoints

```text
POST /api/v1/investments/tokens/:tokenUid/purchases
POST /api/v1/investments/purchases/:purchaseUid/confirm
GET  /api/v1/investments/tokens/:tokenUid/purchases?page=1&limit=20&search=&status=all
GET  /api/v1/investments/me/portfolio?page=1&limit=20&search=
GET  /api/v1/investments/purchases/:purchaseUid
POST /api/v1/investments/purchases/:purchaseUid/retry
```

All calls require the investor JWT.

## Status meanings

| Status | Frontend meaning | Recommended display |
|---|---|---|
| `PENDING_PAYMENT` | Intent exists; MetaMask may not have returned a hash yet, or payment verification is pending | Pending payment |
| `PAYMENT_CONFIRMED` | USDT payment was verified; platform mint is queued/processing | Payment confirmed |
| `MINT_SUBMITTED` | Platform mint was broadcast and is awaiting final verification | Minting |
| `COMPLETED` | Payment and mint were independently verified | Completed |
| `EXPIRED` | No payment hash/event was received before the deadline | Expired |

HTTP 200 means the Confirm request was handled and the returned database state is valid. It does
not mean the purchase is completed. Completion is only `data.status === "COMPLETED"`.

## Page initialization

When the token purchase page opens, call:

```http
GET /api/v1/investments/tokens/{tokenUid}/purchases?page=1&limit=20&search=&status=all
```

Render `data` as the transaction table and use `meta` for pagination. The response is investor
scoped: another investor's purchases are never included. Suggested columns are date, token amount,
USDT amount, status, payment hash, mint hash, completed time, and expiration reason.

Supported history filters:

- `status`: `all`, `PENDING_PAYMENT`, `PAYMENT_CONFIRMED`, `MINT_SUBMITTED`, `COMPLETED`, or
  `EXPIRED`.
- `search`: up to 100 characters. It searches purchase UID, idempotency key, payment/mint hashes,
  token/investor/treasury addresses, token amount, and USDT amount.

Reset `page` to `1` whenever search or status changes. Debounce search input by approximately
300–500 ms, cancel the previous request when possible, and send `status=all` to remove the filter.

For an expandable row or audit drawer, call:

```http
GET /api/v1/investments/purchases/{purchaseUid}
```

That endpoint includes `transactionHistory` with payment/mint attempts. Do not call the detail API
for every table row on initial load.

## Start purchase and MetaMask

1. Disable the Purchase button only while the create request or MetaMask prompt is actively open.
2. Generate a new idempotency key for a genuinely new checkout.
3. Call Create Purchase with the entered token amount.
4. Store the returned `purchaseUid`, authoritative USDT address, treasury address,
   `usdtAmountRaw`, and `expiration.expiresAt`.
5. Do not recompute the amount using JavaScript floating-point arithmetic.
6. Before opening MetaMask, verify the current time is before `expiration.expiresAt`.
7. Ask MetaMask to call USDT `transfer(treasuryWalletAddress, usdtAmountRaw)`.

```ts
const created = await api.post(
  `/api/v1/investments/tokens/${tokenUid}/purchases`,
  { tokenAmount, idempotencyKey },
);

const purchase = created.data.data;
if (purchase.status === 'EXPIRED') {
  // The same idempotency key referred to an old checkout. Generate a new key and create again.
  return;
}

const tx = await usdt.transfer(
  purchase.treasuryWalletAddress,
  BigInt(purchase.usdtAmountRaw),
);
```

Depending on the connected MetaMask account type, the submitted transaction can be a direct USDT
call or a delegated-wallet execution whose outer recipient is MetaMask's execution contract. Do
not reject or reinterpret such a hash in the frontend based on `tx.to`. Send the returned hash to
Confirm unchanged. The backend validates the transaction sender and canonical receipt, then
requires the configured USDT contract to have emitted the exact investor-to-treasury `Transfer`
event for `usdtAmountRaw` before it confirms payment.

The backend allows only one unsettled purchase per investor. Therefore, clicking Purchase again
while an earlier row is active may return that existing row instead of creating a duplicate. The
button can remain enabled, but the frontend must inspect the returned `purchaseUid` and status.

## When to call Confirm

Call Confirm only after MetaMask returns a real transaction hash:

```ts
const response = await api.post(
  `/api/v1/investments/purchases/${purchase.purchaseUid}/confirm`,
  { txHash: tx.hash },
);

const current = response.data.data;
switch (current.status) {
  case 'COMPLETED':
    showSuccess('Purchase completed');
    break;
  case 'PAYMENT_CONFIRMED':
  case 'MINT_SUBMITTED':
    showInfo('Payment received; token settlement is continuing');
    break;
  case 'PENDING_PAYMENT':
    showInfo('Payment verification is continuing');
    break;
  case 'EXPIRED':
    showWarning('This payment intent expired. Start a new purchase.');
    break;
}
```

Confirm returns HTTP 200 for every valid persisted lifecycle result above. Verification mismatches,
wrong/duplicate hashes, unauthorized access, and malformed requests still return their normal
4xx errors and must be shown as errors.

Do not call Confirm when MetaMask is rejected or closed before a transaction hash exists. Re-enable
the Purchase button, refresh history, and let the background runner expire the abandoned intent.
Never invent a hash or send an empty value.

## When to refresh history

Call the token history endpoint:

- when the page first opens;
- immediately after Create Purchase returns;
- after MetaMask is rejected/closed;
- after every Confirm response or Confirm error;
- after Retry returns;
- when the user manually refreshes the table;
- while a visible row is active, using controlled polling.

Preserve the current `search`, `status`, `page`, and `limit` values when polling so the table does
not unexpectedly change filters.

A 5–10 second polling interval is sufficient while the current page contains
`PENDING_PAYMENT`, `PAYMENT_CONFIRMED`, or `MINT_SUBMITTED`. Stop polling when the page is hidden or
all visible rows are terminal (`COMPLETED` or `EXPIRED`). Avoid overlapping requests.

## Button lifecycle

Use a local UI flag such as `isPurchaseActionRunning`; do not permanently disable the button based
on an old table row.

```ts
setPurchaseActionRunning(true);
try {
  const purchase = await createPurchase();
  const hash = await openMetaMask(purchase);
  if (hash) await confirmPurchase(purchase.purchaseUid, hash);
} finally {
  setPurchaseActionRunning(false);
  await refreshPurchaseHistory();
}
```

This re-enables the button regardless of the returned lifecycle status. Backend idempotency and the
single-active-purchase rule remain the final duplicate protection.

## Abandoned and expired intents

Create Purchase returns `expiration.expiresAt`. If MetaMask is closed and no hash is submitted:

1. The row stays visible as `PENDING_PAYMENT` until its deadline and safety grace pass.
2. The backend first catches its global USDT indexer up after any outage.
3. If no matching payment hash/event exists, the runner marks it `EXPIRED`.
4. The history table shows `EXPIRED` and `expiration.reason = PAYMENT_NOT_SUBMITTED`.
5. A new purchase uses a new idempotency key.

Do not initiate a transfer after `expiresAt`. An expired Confirm returns HTTP 200 with
`data.status = "EXPIRED"`, but it does not attach or process the late hash.

## Recommended state model

Keep these concerns separate:

```text
isPurchaseActionRunning  -> controls button spinner/temporary disabling
purchaseHistory[]        -> renders durable backend rows
selectedPurchase         -> optional detail drawer
pollTimer                -> refreshes only while active rows are visible
```

Never remove an older row just because a new checkout begins. Refresh from the history endpoint and
let `purchaseUid` identify each row.

## Portfolio screen

Call `GET /api/v1/investments/me/portfolio` when the Portfolio menu opens and after a purchase or
redemption reaches `COMPLETED`. Render one card/row per returned token. Use the top-level token
fields for name, symbol, image, price, issuer, chain, addresses, restrictions, and required claims.
Use the nested `portfolio` object for `totalPurchasedTokenAmount`, `totalInvestedUsdtAmount`,
`totalRedeemedTokenAmount`, `netTokenAmount`, `averagePurchasePrice`, counts, and activity dates.

The endpoint contains only tokens having at least one completed purchase. It excludes pending,
failed, and expired purchase amounts. The net amount subtracts only completed redemptions. Use
`imageUrl` as an authenticated relative API URL, and use `tokenUid` to navigate to the existing
marketplace token-details route.
