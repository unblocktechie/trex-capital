/**
 * Phase 0 / Step 1b — redeploy ONLY TREXFactory after a Factory-side contract
 * change (here: TokenPriceStorage integration) and repoint the EXISTING
 * TREXGateway at it.
 *
 * Why this script exists instead of re-running phase0-01-deploy-platform.ts:
 *   phase0-01 pulls contracts from the published npm package
 *   `@erc3643org/erc-3643@4.1.3`, which does NOT contain the TokenPriceStorage
 *   changes (those only exist in the local ERC-3643 repo source). Nothing else
 *   changed (implementations, TREXImplementationAuthority, IdFactory,
 *   TREXGateway are all untouched), so a full platform redeploy is unnecessary
 *   and would orphan every already-deployed issuer suite for no reason.
 *
 * What this script does:
 *   1. Loads TREXFactory's ABI/bytecode from vendor/erc3643/ in THIS project
 *      (NOT the npm package, which doesn't have TokenPriceStorage yet). That
 *      vendored copy is produced by `npm run sync:erc3643-artifacts` — see
 *      sync-erc3643-artifacts.ts. Run that (after compiling ERC-3643) any
 *      time TREXFactory/TokenPriceStorage change, before running this script.
 *   2. Deploys a new TREXFactory pointing at the SAME
 *      TREXImplementationAuthority + IdFactory already in deployments/sepolia.json.
 *   3. Whitelists the new Factory on IdFactory (addTokenFactory) and removes
 *      the old one (removeTokenFactory) so only the live Factory can create
 *      token identities going forward.
 *   4. Transfers the new Factory's ownership to the EXISTING TREXGateway
 *      (deployTREXSuite is onlyOwner).
 *   5. Calls TREXGateway.setFactory(newFactory) — your backend keeps using the
 *      same Gateway address it always has; only the Factory it forwards to changes.
 *   6. Updates deployments/sepolia.json, keeping the old Factory address in
 *      `platform.trexFactoryHistory` for audit purposes.
 *
 * IMPORTANT — long-term fix: this script reads TREXFactory from
 * vendor/erc3643/ (a checked-in copy inside THIS project, see
 * sync-erc3643-artifacts.ts), not a live path into another repo, so it works
 * the same on any machine/CI as long as vendor/erc3643/ is up to date. Once
 * TokenPriceStorage lands in a published/internal package version, this
 * script and the vendor/ folder become unnecessary and
 * phase0-01-deploy-platform.ts can be used as-is for future environments
 * (e.g. mainnet).
