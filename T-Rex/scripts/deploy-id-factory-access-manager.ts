/**
 * One-time deployment for IdFactoryAccessManager
 * (contracts/platform/IdFactoryAccessManager.sol), the access-control front
 * door for this network's IdFactory (ONCHAINID).
 *
 * Requires `npm run compile` to have been run first, so the artifact this
 * deploys from actually exists on disk, and requires the platform to already
 * be deployed (deployments/<network>.json must have platform.identityFactory
 * set — see phase0-01-deploy-platform.ts / deploy-chain.ts).
 *
 * Constructor arguments:
 *   - idFactory: platform.identityFactory from deployments/<network>.json,
 *     unless overridden via ID_FACTORY_ADDRESS in .env.
 *   - defaultAdmin: ID_FACTORY_ACCESS_MANAGER_ADMIN_ADDRESS in .env if set
 *     (should be a multisig — see the contract's constructor docs), else
 *     falls back to the deployer wallet's own address.
 *
 * IMPORTANT (manual step after this script finishes): the current owner of
 * IdFactory must call IdFactory.transferOwnership(<this contract's address>)
 * before any of IdFactoryAccessManager's forwarding functions will work.
